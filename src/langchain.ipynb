        "LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It provides several abstractions for interacting with LLMs, which allows the use of LLMs for boilerplate use cases like Q&A within a few lines of code. Additionally, you can chain together logic and integrate with a plethora of platforms.\n",

        "\n",
        "- A wide range of tool and platform integrations.\n",
        "- Simple abstractions to complex functionality with limited code footprint.\n",
        "- Allow access to external sources of information, such as the internet and other knowledge bases.\n",

        "[Auto GPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT) is an experimental open-source application showcasing the capabilities of the GPT-4 language model. This program, driven by GPT-4, chains together LLM \"thoughts\", to autonomously achieve whatever goal you set. As one of the first examples of GPT-4 running fully autonomously, Auto-GPT pushes the boundaries of what is possible with AI.\n",

        "- Similar verbage is shared, ie \"chains\" - showing the have similar goals in wrapping logic around LLMs.\n",
        "- by default, Auto GPT seems to be excellent via the command line.\n",
        "- It is deemed clearly as an experimental and rough project, this differs in comparison to Langchains broad documentation and professional facade. In general Auto GPT is less robust.\n",
        "- Auto GPT is goal orientated, with the intention of giving the AI a clear goal and then via its own functionality and ability to access various data sources it tries to achieve the goal. This is a less structured appraoch compared to Langchain which in essence is an orchestration tool for LLMs.\n",
        "  - IE you might use Langchain on top of AutoGPT.\n",
        "  - Auto GPT really is about a fully AUTONMOUS agent, rather than structured logic and controls.\n",
        "  - It is designed to provide targeted, goal-oriented solutions by segmenting larger objectives, like “establishing an online business”, into a sequence of manageable, smaller subtasks, such as “creating a Twitter account and publishing relevant content”. Then, with remarkable autonomy, it tirelessly executes these subtasks.\n",
        "    - Natural language instructions are what is given to Auto GPT."
